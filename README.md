# Boston-and-Seattle-Airbnb-Analysis

## Introduction
Airbnb, Inc. was founded by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia in 2008. It is an American company headquartered in San Francisco, California and operates as an online marketplace primarily for homestays vacation rentals, lodging and tourism activities.
The company has increased in growth and now services its members world wide and well as having its platform accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb makes its profits by receiving commission from each booking and doesnâ€™t own any of their listed properties.

I will be using the [Boston AirNNB](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle AirBnB](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) data for the analysis in this project. I would also be following the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** process as shown in my Jupyter notebook.

### Installation
In this project, all the relevant packages for analysis and model building were used. Some of them are the following :

    1. numpy
    2. pandas
    3. seaborn
    4. matplotlib
    5. sklearn
    6. RandomForestRegressor
 


### File Description
The data files contains the following main components:

    1. Calendar data: includes home availability, price and listing id.
    2. Listing data: includes full description and average review score of listings.
    3. Reviews data: includes house reviews and detailed comments from reviewers, unique id.
    

### Project Motivation
My main goal in this project is to understand which city is AirBNB giving customers a better experiences with respect to cost and living experiences between Boston and Seattle and predict the price of a listing using the Boston dataset.
I will try to answer this question by having a deep understanding of the questions below:

    1. What factors affect the listing prices the most in both cities?
    2. How does prices differ between Boston and Seattle?
    3. Can we predict the price of a listing?     
    
### Results Summary
A detailed analysis and results summary can be found in my Jupyter notebook **Boston and Seattle Airbnb Analysis.ipynb** and my [blog post](https://medium.com/@bokeke_37284/boston-and-seattle-airbnb-analysis-4be7230a01fb).
