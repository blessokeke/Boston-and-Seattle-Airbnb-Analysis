# Boston-and-Seattle-Airbnb-Analysis
This is one of my projects from my Data Scientist Udacity Nanodegree program. I will start by doing a detailed descriptive analysis of my data.
I will be using the [Boston AirNNB](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle AirBnB](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) data for this project. In this project, I would be following the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** process as shown in my Jupyter notebook.

### Installation
In this project, all the relevant packages for analysis and model building were used. Some of them are the following :

    1. numpy
    2. pandas
    3. seaborn
    4. matplotlib
    5. sklearn
    6. RandomForestRegressor
 


### File Description
The data files contains the following main components:

    1. Calendar data: includes home availability, price and listing id.
    2. Listing data: includes full description and average review score of listings.
    3. Reviews data: includes house reviews and detailed comments from reviewers, unique id.
    

### Project Motivation
My main goal in this project is to understand which city is AirBNB giving customers a better experiences with respect to cost and living experiences between Boston and Seattle and predict the price of a listing using the Boston dataset.
I will try to answer this question by having a deep understanding of the questions below:

    1. What factors affect the listing prices the most in both cities?
    2. How does prices differ between Boston and Seattle?
    3. Can we predict the price of a listing?     
    
### Results Summary
A detailed analysis and results summary can be found in my Jupyter notebook **Boston and Seattle Airbnb Analysis.ipynb** and my [blog post](https://medium.com/@bokeke_37284/boston-and-seattle-airbnb-analysis-4be7230a01fb).


### Acknowledgment
Many thanks to Udacity for giving me an opportunity to try out real world problems. Thanks to the Data Scientists who have inspired and provided insights to me through Kaggle, Github and StackOverflow.
